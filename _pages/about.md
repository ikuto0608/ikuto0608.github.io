## I'm a Ruby on Rails / AngularJS 2 developer in Vancouver.

I'm Ikuto, 27, and I'd like to do programming like breathing naturally.
I lately focus on Ruby on Rails and Angular2. I began programming because I wanted to get power that put my idea on real anytime I hit upon a good idea.

## I built memorizing app.

I have an own project which is hybrid application for memorizing words. It's based on Ruby on Rails, Nativescript and Angular2.
* [Memorise](https://memoriseword.com/)
* [Mobile client repositry](https://github.com/ikuto0608/mwa_client_mobile)
* [Web client repositry](https://github.com/ikuto0608/mwa_client)
* [Server repositry](https://github.com/ikuto0608/mwa_server)

## Learning AI is my next stage.

I believe people can write programming like using own language near future. So
I want new rare skill. Then I started to learn neural network and deep learning.
