I'm Ikuto, 27, and I'd like to do programming like breathing naturally.
I lately focus on Angular2 or more, Nativescript and Ruby on Rails. I began programming because I wanted to get power that put my idea on real anytime I hit upon a good idea.

I'm currently learning about programming at ITD Canada (It's one of college) in Vancouver. And I'll work as programmer in Vancouver for 2 years using Co-op program and working holiday Visa from 2017 April.

I had worked as programmer for 4 years in Japan before came Vancouver. I was using Ruby on Rails, C++ and Java.
