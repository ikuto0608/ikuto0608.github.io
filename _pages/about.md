## I'm a Ruby on Rails / AngularJS 2 developer in Vancouver.

I'm Ikuto, 27, and I'd like to be able to do programming like breathing naturally.
Lately, I've focused on Ruby on Rails and AngularJS 2. I began programming because I wanted to have the power to make my ideas real, anytime I hit upon a good idea.

### I built a memorizing app.

I have my own project which is [hybrid application](https://memoriseword.com/) for memorizing words. It's based on Ruby on Rails, Nativescript and Angular2.

### Learning AI is my next stage.

I expect people will be able to do programming as though speaking their native language in the near future. So I want a new rare skill. I've started to learn Neural Network and Deep Learning.
